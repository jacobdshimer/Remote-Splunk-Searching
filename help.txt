usage: main.py [-h] -s SEARCH [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-o OUTPUT_MODE]
               [-of] [-host HOSTNAME] [--port SPLUNKDPORT]

This is a utility script to send searches to Splunk. If ran with switch
statements, it will take the username, password and hostname from them if
there are no switch statements other then the search string, then it will
attempt to open a settings.json. If one is not available, then it will ask in
the command prompt for the username, password, and hostname.
